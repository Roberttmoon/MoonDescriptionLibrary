* Moon Description Library
** rationality
This is a collection of descriptions of high level items that may be
used around various repositories. These could be the blocks of
web pages or API that are too small to be in their own repositories.

Largely, this is an attempt to unify elements across different
programs that may use the same concepts or data. Also provides a way
to explore building and maintain a multi-platform structure.

** Repository structure
Each element should be in their own folder, for the time being the
descriptions will be in JSON but that is subject to change depending
on project needs.
